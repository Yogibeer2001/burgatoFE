## Project Approach /  Technologies Used

Ruby on Rails back end to produce an REST API || REST API consumed by Ember.js front end

### Back End Application

##### Ruby on Rails
Rails 4 was used as the back end of our project. GitHub repository for our back end application is available here:
[Back End Rails Application Github repository](https://github.com/Yogibeer2001/Burgato)

We decided to use rails as our back end given our competence with this framework. Our research also indicated that when undertaking API driven development rails is one of the most popular frameworks.

### Front End Application

##### Ember.js

Our research suggested that Ember.js is gaining momentum as a front end framework with a number of popular websites using ember.js as their front end MVC framework.

Ember is also considered highly suitable for consuming a JSON APIs with a number blogs and developers advocating the user of a Rails back end / Ember.js front end technology stack.

## Problems / Bugs encountered



## Lessons learnt

#### Reach out to the Community

We posted a number of questions on the Ember slack channel which were met with really helpful responses. Some of the community resources provided to us are as follows:

1. Guides will be your best source for 2.6+ updates. There are also a lot of hidden nuggets not in the guides in release posts if you can dig those up.
2. Visual learner? Be sure to check out global ember meetup and each cities individual meetups, NYC, SF, and so on for regular updates each month. Subscribe on youtube.
3. Want something more premium? Jeffrey Biles has some good ember screencasts.
4. Need some books? Check out Ember CLI 101 for the basics, Ember Rock n Roll is updated quite often too. Erik dropped his Ember Cookbook too which is nice.
5. Blog wise I enjoy Frank Treacy, Program with Erik, and Dockyards blog as they always have fresh stuff.
6. Be sure to check out Ember Observer for addons to save yourself some time.
7. Prefer to listen? Ember Weekend has a podcast that is nice to catch up on whats happening in the community.
8. Real time? Slack most folks are cool with answering questions in here. Plenty of channels to hop around in.
9. Use Ember Twiddle for some quick gisting of code if you need to troubleshoot or share.
